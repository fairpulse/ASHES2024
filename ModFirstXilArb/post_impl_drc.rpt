2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net arbpuf/fiabot/outwl[15] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin arbpuf/fiabot/BotLine[14].muxer/O, cell arbpuf/fiabot/BotLine[14].muxer. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net arbpuf/fiatop/outwl[15] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin arbpuf/fiatop/TopLine[14].muxer/O, cell arbpuf/fiatop/TopLine[14].muxer. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ten is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ten_inferred_i_1/O, cell ten_inferred_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT arbpuf/fiabot/BotLine[14].muxer is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    arbpuf/fiabot/dffl {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT arbpuf/fiatop/TopLine[14].muxer is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    arbpuf/fiatop/dffl {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT ten_inferred_i_1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    arbpuf/dff3 {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>
