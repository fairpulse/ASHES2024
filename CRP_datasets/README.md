# CRP Datasets
## A Challenge File and few Response Files acquired from various FPGA boards 

<!-- In each .txt file there are 2,097,152 rows, wherein each row contains the response for a corresponding Challenge in the 
following encoding:
- > ffffffffffff **RESP** 0a0a
  > 
where RESP is the 16-bit (Four Hex Characters) Response string
- > For example, ffffffffffff02200a0a corresponds to RESP=0220 (in Hexadecimal)= 0000 0010 0010 0000 (in Binary) -->
